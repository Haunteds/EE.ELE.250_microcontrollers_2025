# EE.ELE.250_microcontrollers_2025
This project is based on Tampere University course Microcontrollers, EE.ELE.250.


The project consists of a Proteus file and a C-file. The Proteus file has been tested in Proteus 8 environment and it contains the circuit diagram and the PCB layout for the microctroller.
The used microcontroller in this project is the ATmega328P.
The C-file has the functionality and the needed functions to simulate the microcontroller in Proteus.
